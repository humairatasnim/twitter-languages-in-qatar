Twitter Languages in Qatar v1.0
==========================

<h3>Project Overview</h3>

The objective of this project was to create an interactive map that shows the language distribution of geolocated tweets that have been collected around the State of Qatar. The idea was to visualize the data available from Twitter and to bring out interesting trends that exist in the diverse population demographics of Qatar.

In this project, first the raw tweets during a particular period of time were collected, and the languages of the geolocated tweets were then determined using the Language Detection API. The tweets were then marked on the map using grid-based clustering, where the map was divided into squares of a certain size, and the tweets were grouped into each grid square. For each grid square, there was a centroid marker which displayed a pie chart representing the different languages that people tweeted in. With this step, we hoped to get a rough insight about the population demographics in the corresponding areas.
